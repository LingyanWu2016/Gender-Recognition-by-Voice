# Gender-Recognition-by-Voice

This project trains a computer program to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R and then processed with artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms to learn gender-specific traits for classifying the voice as male or female.

The pre-processed dataset was saved into a CSV file,containing 3168 instances and 21 columns (20 columns for each attribute and onelabel column for the classification of male or female).

It has built an ensemble model that provides improved results over the given data up to 98.5 % to determine the gender of a person by using his or her voice data.
